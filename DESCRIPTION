Description: This package offers a direct method to quantify the cellular
    prevalence of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using phase information. The
    method utilizes three sources of information: the phasing information, the copy
    number variation, and the allele counts. The method is demonstrated to bring
    more capabilities in Cancer Genomic and allows computing the cell prevalence of
    a mutation in various cancer contexts.
