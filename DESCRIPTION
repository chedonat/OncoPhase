Description: This package offers a direct method to accurately quantify the cellular
    prevalence of somatic mutations in cancer using phase information. The
    method utilizes three sources of information: the phasing information, the copy
    number variation, and the allele counts. The method is demonstrated to bring
    more capabilities in Cancer Genomic.
