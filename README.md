# OncoPhase
OncoPhase: Quantification of somatic mutation cellular prevalence using phase information.

Developed in the Ovarian Cancer Cell Laboratory, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.

This package offers a direct method to quantify the cellular
prevalence of a somatic mutation  using phase information. The
method utilizes three sources of information: the phasing information, the copy
number variation, and the allele counts. The method is demonstrated to bring
more capabilities in Cancer Genomics.
